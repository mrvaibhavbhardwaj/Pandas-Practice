This repository contains my hands-on practice of essential Pandas operations used in data analysis and preprocessing.

The notebook includes 24 real-world style problems covering:

1. Series & DataFrame creation

2. Data filtering & selection

3. Handling missing values

4. Outlier detection & capping

5. CSV import customization

6. Column reordering

7. Row filtering

8. Statistical summaries

9.Date-time conversion

10.Frequency analysis

The goal of this project was to build strong fundamentals in data manipulation and prepare for real-world datasets.

This serves as a foundational step toward advanced analytics and machine learning workflows.
